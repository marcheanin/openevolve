Examples where the model made errors (review + gold label):
  - Review: I like the Stasher Snack bag. It is the perfect size for snacks on the go. I also like that you can store, cook, put in the microwave or even in the dishwasher! This is great for small treats. Don't try to overstuff. You don't want the seal to get food bits stuck in the zip track. I use Ziploc bags ...

  - Review: I love the collapsible polyester storage basked by DII. I have several and I find them great for storing items and for moving items from room to room. Also make great little holders for toys or laundry. The pattern is attractive and I can put a lot of items in a medium sized basket. They stand up we...

  - Review: We own a huge amount of Lodge cast iron cook and bake ware plus a few odd pieces collected over the years. Although I've tried other brands in the past, Lodge remained the best.

  - Review: This is a pretty excellent sack. It seals really really well. So well that it did not leak at all when I loaded it with still steaming soup. Despite building up pressure, the seal did not unseal and the soup stayed in the bag and out of my fridge.  It is plenty big to hold a good sized sandwich, is ...

  - Review: This is a coffee pot for coffee geeks.  Most discerning coffee aficionados likely wouldn't notice much if any difference from a a great less complicated coffee make, such as a Bonavita.  To cut to the point, this probably isn't for you, but who knows, so read on ...

If you look at it and think: "OM...

  - Review: Between a puppy and frequent visits from children, I've definitely had times when it felt like the gap between proper carpet cleanings was entirely too long. On the other hand, I never entirely bought the idea that a device of this type could turn out to be really useful.

It's been doing surprising...
