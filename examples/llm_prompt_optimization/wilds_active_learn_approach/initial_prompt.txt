</BaseGuidelines>

<DynamicRules>
    STAR LEVEL CRITERIA:

    1 Star (Very Negative):
    - Strong dissatisfaction or anger
    - Product is defective, unsafe, completely ineffective, or returned
    - Clear statements such as "terrible," "junk," "don't buy," "returned," "doesn't work"
    - Safety hazards or total failure automatically lean toward 1

    2 Stars (Negative):
    - More negative than positive
    - Significant flaws, poor quality, missing parts, misleading description
    - Some limited usefulness but strong disappointment
    - Language such as "cheap," "useless," "not as pictured," "pain to use"

    3 Stars (Neutral / Mixed):
    - Balanced pros and cons
    - "It's okay," "average," "not great but not terrible"
    - Works but with noticeable limitations
    - Conflicted or moderate tone
    - If sentiment is clearly mixed and neither side dominates, choose 3

    4 Stars (Positive):
    - Mostly positive with minor criticisms
    - Product works well but not perfect
    - Phrases like "pretty good," "above average," "would recommend"
    - Minor complaints that do not override satisfaction

    5 Stars (Very Positive):
    - Strong satisfaction and enthusiasm
    - Clear recommendation to others
    - Exceeds expectations
    - Phrases like "love it," "perfect," "excellent," "extremely happy," "worth every penny"

    EDGE CASE HANDLING:

    - Mixed sentiment: Weigh overall conclusion more heavily than isolated complaints.
    - Updates: If a review ends negatively after an update, prioritize the final evaluation.
    - Sarcasm: Detect implicit negativity even if positive words are used ironically.
    - Comparison phrasing: If the reviewer says they would not buy again → likely 1 or 2.
    - "Better than nothing" → usually 3.
    - Minor inconvenience but strong satisfaction → 4.
    - If safety risk is mentioned → lean toward 1.
    - If price is praised despite limitations → lean toward 4 or 5 depending on tone.

<FewShotExamples>

Example 1:
Review: It's not a good vacuum. It's hard to pick up dirt and then it will spit it out so you have to go over and over the same area. I wouldn't buy it again.
Rating: 1

Example 2:
Review: Arrived broken. :(
Rating: 1

Example 3:
Review: The cushions are okay, but the size was waaaay off for my rocker. I'm still using it though because it is better than nothing.
Rating: 3

Example 4:
Review: I'd rate this as pretty good although it doesn't feel quite as heavy duty as the ones we've been using for the past few years... Overall I'd rate this as above average although only time will tell how durable it is.
Rating: 4

Example 5:
Review: This is a great table cloth. It is well made, holds up to many washes, and is well worth the price. Get it and entertain better than ever!
Rating: 5

Example 6:
Review: Very poor quality. Cheap fabric, not as pictured and the color was off. Returned the next day.
Rating: 1

Example 7:
Review: These are really nice IF you only use them for bigger items. They are too thick and bulky for smaller items.
Rating: 3
