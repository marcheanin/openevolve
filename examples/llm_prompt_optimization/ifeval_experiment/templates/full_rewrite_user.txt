# Task
Rewrite the prompt to improve its performance on the specified metrics.
Focus on clarity, specificity, and effectiveness for the IFEval (Instruction Following Evaluation) task.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Keep the EXACT same placeholder from the original prompt: {{instruction}}
2. Do not add any new placeholders or change existing ones
3. Make the instructions clearer and more specific about following all constraints
4. Emphasize precision, attention to detail, and constraint adherence
5. Focus on what will improve accuracy in following complex, multi-constraint instructions
6. Keep the prompt concise but effective

The prompt should help the model:
- Carefully read all requirements and constraints in the instruction
- Pay attention to formatting requirements (word count, sentence count, forbidden words, etc.)
- Produce responses that precisely match all specified constraints
- Avoid common mistakes like missing constraints or incorrect formatting

Provide ONLY the complete new prompt text, with no additional commentary:
