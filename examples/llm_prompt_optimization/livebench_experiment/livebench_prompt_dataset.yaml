# LiveBench Instruction Following dataset configuration
dataset_name: "livebench/instruction_following"
input_field: "turns"  # The instruction turns
target_field: "instruction_id_list"  # List of instruction IDs to check
split: "test"  # LiveBench uses test split

# Optional: Filter by LiveBench release date
# Set to null to use all available data
# livebench_release: "2024-11-25"  # Use questions up to this release
livebench_release: null  # Use all available questions

# Dataset splitting for proper evaluation
# Dataset will be automatically split into train/validation/test
train_ratio: 0.7      # 70% for evolution
validation_ratio: 0.15  # 15% for monitoring overfitting
test_ratio: 0.15      # 15% for final evaluation (not used during evolution)
split_seed: 42        # Seed for reproducible splitting

# Evaluation parameters
# Note: max_samples is ignored, adaptive sample sizes are used
max_samples: 200        # Deprecated: using adaptive sample sizes
full_eval_samples: 500  # Approximate full dataset size

# Special processing flags
is_livebench: true
trust_remote_code: false
streaming: false  # Must be False for splitting capability
